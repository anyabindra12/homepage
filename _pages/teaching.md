15122 : Data Structures and Algorithms, a typical CS course about BFS, DFS, Hash Tables, Big O

21241 : Linear Transformation and Matrices, Learnt SVD, Gram Schmidt, Jordan Canonical Form, Eigenvalue equation $$A \vec{x} = \lambda \vec{x}$$

21325 : Central Limit Theorem, Berry Essen, beautiful results on convergence of random variables, one of the best classes at CMU :)

21228 : Discrete Math with Po Shen :) Intro to Ramsey Theory, cool stuff on Lucas theorem, Catalan numbers.

18220 : $$V=L \frac{di}{dt}$$, RL, RC circuits. Analog Filters. The labs were cool, built a remote control for TV, (very slow) phone charger etc

18290 : Fourier Series and Transforms, Hamming windows on Matlab, signal processing. The definition we learn for FT is $$\hat{f}(\zeta)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2 \pi i \zeta x} dx$$ and most problems are computing FTs and IFTs of periodic and non periodic signals.

80310 : Proved soundness and completeness of first order logic

21259 : 3D Calc, $$\int_{C} F \cdot dr = \iint_{S} \mathrm{curl} \hspace{2pt} F \cdot dS$$, Stokes and Divergence Theorems, Greenâ€™s theorem, quadric surfaces, directional derivatives etc

18100 : Intro to ECE. Labs were cool, built a transmitter and receiver for radio, current to voltage converter, digital circuits
